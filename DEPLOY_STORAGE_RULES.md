# Deploy Firebase Storage Rules

To fix the storage permission error, you need to deploy the updated storage rules to Firebase:

## Option 1: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended)

1. Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project directory:
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```
   - Select "Storage: Configure a security rules file for Cloud Storage"
   - Use existing project: "invisible-mechanics---2"
   - Use the default storage.rules file

4. Deploy the storage rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

## Option 2: Manual Update in Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: "invisible-mechanics---2"
3. Navigate to Storage > Rules
4. Replace the existing rules with:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Development rules - CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION
    // Allow all reads and writes for development
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click "Publish"

## Important Security Note

The current rules allow ALL users to read and write to your storage. This is only for development/testing. 

For production, use more restrictive rules like:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Only allow authenticated users to upload
    match /breakdowns/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
